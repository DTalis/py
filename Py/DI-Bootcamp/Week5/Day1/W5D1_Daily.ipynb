        "\n",
        "Machine Learning (ML) is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn patterns from data and improve their performance on a task without being explicitly programmed.\n",
        "Instead of using hard-coded rules, ML models automatically identify relationships in datasets and use them to make predictions, classifications, or decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why Machine Learning is Important for Data Analysts\n",
        "\t•\tIt allows analysts to go beyond descriptive analysis and move into prediction and automation.\n",
        "\t•\tML helps reveal hidden patterns in large datasets that traditional statistics might miss.\n",
        "\t•\tIt enables data-driven decision-making in real time, improving business processes and efficiency.\n",
        "\t•\tML is used to build predictive dashboards, risk scoring systems, forecasting tools, and recommendation engines—making analysts more valuable in modern organizations.\n",
