Sampling bias (e.g., only past approved applicants) can skew results; we will correct with reject inference or careful evaluation to avoid optimism. Fair-lending and discrimination risks require excluding protected attributes and testing for disparate impact, while maintaining model explainability for adverse-action notices. Finally, we will operate under model-risk management and governance—documenting assumptions, versioning data and code, monitoring drift/calibration, and establishing periodic re-training and review."

        "\n",
        "ApplicantIncome is relevant because higher or more stable income generally improves a borrower’s ability to meet monthly repayment obligations, reducing default risk.\n",
        "CoapplicantIncome matters because combined household income can significantly strengthen loan affordability and reduce financial stress.\n",
        "LoanAmount is important because larger loan sizes increase the repayment burden, which may elevate the likelihood of default, especially for applicants with lower income.\n",
        "Loan_Amount_Term affects default risk because the repayment period determines monthly installment size; shorter terms increase monthly payments and may raise default probability.\n",
        "Credit_History is one of the strongest predictors because borrowers with a clean repayment record are statistically more likely to meet their obligations on a new loan.\n",
        "Dependents contribute useful information because applicants with more dependents typically face higher household expenses, potentially worsening repayment capacity.\n",
        "Education helps capture differences in long-term earning potential and financial stability, making it indirectly related to loan repayment performance.\n",
        "Self_Employed status is relevant because self-employment incomes tend to be more volatile, which can increase repayment uncertainty.\n",
        "Married status may impact financial stability, because dual-income households may be more resilient and better able to manage unexpected expenses.\n",
        "Gender can be included because it is part of the dataset, but it should be used with caution, as it may not be ethically or legally appropriate in real credit models; however, in this academic dataset it may still contribute to prediction power.\n",
        "Property_Area is relevant because urban, semi-urban, and rural areas differ in income opportunities, stability, and loan pricing, all of which influence repayment behavior.\n",

        "I would select Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier as the two primary candidate models. Logistic Regression is suitable because it is interpretable, works well on structured tabular data, and provides calibrated probability estimates that are essential for credit-risk decisions. Random Forest is suitable because it can capture nonlinear relationships and interactions between variables, is robust to outliers and missingness, and typically performs strongly on medium-sized structured datasets like loan applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "To evaluate these models, I would begin by splitting the dataset into training (70–80%) and testing (20–30%) sets using a stratified split to preserve the proportion of approved versus rejected loans. I would use k-fold cross-validation (typically k=5 or k=10) on the training set to obtain stable performance estimates and reduce variance. The main evaluation metrics would include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and PR-AUC, because these metrics collectively capture both overall correctness and the ability to detect high-risk borrowers. I would choose the final decision threshold by analyzing the precision-recall trade-off and selecting a cutoff that aligns with business priorities—for example, prioritizing recall if the institution wants to minimize approving risky customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "To address class imbalance, I would apply stratified sampling during all train/test splits and cross-validation folds to maintain consistent class proportions. Additionally, I would experiment with class weights (for example, class_weight=\"balanced\") during model training or apply resampling techniques such as SMOTE or random under-sampling to ensure that minority-class signals are learned effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, I would tune hyperparameters using grid search or randomized search applied only to the training folds, ensuring that the test set remains untouched to avoid data leakage. Hyperparameter tuning would include parameters such as regularization strength for Logistic Regression or tree depth and number of estimators for Random Forest, iteratively improving performance without exposing the model to unseen test labels."

        "For a supervised learning model such as a loan default classifier, I would evaluate performance by splitting the dataset into training and testing sets using stratified sampling, and then applying k-fold cross-validation on the training set to obtain stable and unbiased performance estimates. I would report several evaluation metrics including accuracy for overall correctness, precision to measure the reliability of identifying defaulters, recall to measure how many true defaulters are captured, and F1-score to summarize the balance between precision and recall. I would also generate a ROC curve to visualize the true-positive/false-positive trade-off and compute the ROC-AUC score as a threshold-independent measure of model discrimination. A key challenge in evaluating supervised models is dealing with class imbalance, which can cause misleading accuracy scores and require careful threshold tuning.\n",

I would use the silhouette score to measure how similar each sample is to its assigned cluster relative to other clusters, and I would apply the elbow method by plotting the within-cluster sum of squared distances to identify the optimal number of clusters. I would also inspect cluster centroids or dendrograms (if using hierarchical clustering) to evaluate whether the cluster assignments align with intuitive or interpretable groupings. A central challenge in evaluating unsupervised models is the absence of ground-truth labels, which makes it difficult to determine whether the discovered structure is meaningful or merely an artifact of the algorithm.\n",

I would assess convergence by monitoring whether the reward curve stabilizes over time, suggesting that the agent has learned a near-optimal policy. I would also evaluate the balance between exploration and exploitation by analyzing the agent’s behavior, such as the frequency of random exploratory actions versus policy-driven decisions, and adjusting parameters like epsilon in an epsilon-greedy strategy when necessary. A key challenge in evaluating reinforcement learning models is that performance can vary greatly between episodes, making it difficult to determine true convergence or stability."
