suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding error handling for edge cases, such as attempting to deal from an empty deck, directly in the shuffle method or in a separate method called 'reset'.
- The shuffle method could be renamed to `reset_deck` or `create_deck` since it initializes the deck as well as shuffles it.
