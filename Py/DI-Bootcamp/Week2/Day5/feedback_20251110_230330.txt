suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding type hints to the `__init__` method's parameters and return value for enhanced readability.
- The use of a static method for `is_anagram` is good; it could be documented more explicitly why it's static (no need for `self`).
- The code could benefit from a docstring explaining the purpose and usage of the class.

suggestions for improvement:
- This submission only provides a text file with a list of words; no code is present.  Therefore, it cannot fulfill any of the instructions related to creating the `AnagramChecker` class or the user interface in `anagrams.py`.
- This file appears to be a word list, not code. It directly provides the data specified but does not implement any functionality related to OOP, file I/O, string manipulation, or algorithm design, as described in the instructions. Therefore, it does not address the core requirements of the exercise.
