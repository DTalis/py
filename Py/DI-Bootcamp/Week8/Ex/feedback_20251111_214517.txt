suggestions for improvement:
- Exercise 2 asked for creating two HTML files - one static and one using JavaScript. This code only provides the JavaScript-enhanced HTML page.
- Exercise 3,4, and 5 required web scraping using Selenium and BeautifulSoup, but there is no code related to web scraping here.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more specific error handling for edge cases during data extraction.
- The code is well structured but could benefit from more comments inline to explain complex regex or data parsing steps.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code uses regular expressions for parsing, which might be fragile if the website's HTML structure changes frequently. Consider more robust parsing methods if possible.
- The code includes a `time.sleep` call. While necessary for waiting for dynamic content, excessive use can slow down the scraping process. Consider using more targeted waiting strategies with `WebDriverWait` and `expected_conditions` if possible.
