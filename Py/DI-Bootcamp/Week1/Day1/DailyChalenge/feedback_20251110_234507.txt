Brief justification:
- correctness: The code perfectly implements all the instructions provided in the chapter content. It correctly asks for user input, validates the length of the string, prints the first and last characters, builds the string character by character, and jumbles the string as a bonus. The output matches the expected behavior described in the instructions and example.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to understand. Variable names are descriptive, and comments are used appropriately to explain the logic. There are no unnecessary complexities.
- performance: The code is efficient and performs all operations in a timely manner. The use of a `for` loop to build the string character by character is a standard and efficient approach. Using `random.shuffle` is also appropriate for jumbling the string.
- security: The code doesn't have any apparent security vulnerabilities. It takes user input but doesn't perform any operations that could be exploited.
