suggestions for improvement:
- The code is well-structured and addresses all the requirements of the daily challenge.
- Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code, further enhancing readability.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately addresses all the tasks outlined in the chapter content, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting structural issues, ensuring correct data types, detecting outliers, and standardizing data. Each step is implemented correctly and logically, as described in the problem statement.
- readability: The code is well-formatted and easy to read. The use of comments to separate different sections improves understanding.  The consistent naming conventions also aid in readability.
- performance: The code's performance is generally good. The use of subqueries in steps 6 and 7 could potentially be optimized for very large datasets, but for the provided dataset size, the performance is adequate.
- security: The code doesn't involve any external input or dynamic SQL execution, making it inherently secure. There are no apparent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
